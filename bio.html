        <p>I experience color, rhythm, texture, and composition as equivalent to music.</p>
        <p>In my mind, the music of John Coltrane and the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky are one.</p>
        <p>My photographic imagery bends light, reimagines shadows, and releases the observer from the mundane- propelling them towards the joy of hidden truths.</p>
